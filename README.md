### Simple Raspberry driver examples

This is a re-adaptation, with some modifications (hopefully improvements), customizations and comments, of the *Johannes4Linux* sourcefiles for the **Linux Driver Tutorial**.

The original repository is available [here](https://github.com/Johannes4Linux/Linux_Driver_Tutorial).
A step-by-step video series is also available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1Y203vH-Dc&list=PLCGpd0Do5-I3b5TtyqeF1UdyD4C-S-dMa).
Not all the 14 sections have been explored here.

These modules have been built and tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running Raspbian:

    $ uname -a
    Linux raspberrypi 5.10.63-v7+ #1459 SMP Wed Oct 6 16:41:10 BST 2021 armv7l GNU/Linux
