This is a re-adaptation, with some modifications (hopefully improvements), customizations and comments, of the *Johannes4Linux* sourcefiles for the **Linux Driver Tutorial**.

The original repository is available [here](https://github.com/Johannes4Linux/Linux_Driver_Tutorial).
A step-by-step video series is also available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1Y203vH-Dc&list=PLCGpd0Do5-I3b5TtyqeF1UdyD4C-S-dMa).
Not all the 14 sections have been explored here.
